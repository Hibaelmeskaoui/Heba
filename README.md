### Software Engineering Student & Web Enthusiast

I am a second-year Software Engineering student passionate about building elegant and functional web experiences.  My academic journey has provided me with a solid foundation in algorithms, data structures, and software development principles, which I actively apply to my front-end development projects.

I am particularly interested in the intersection of code and design, focusing on creating responsive, accessible, and user-friendly websites using modern technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React.
